# Vagrant introduction (Virtual Machines and Nginx)

This repository contains markdown files (and images associated) outlining an introduction to Virtual Machines (VM) created with Vagrant and VirtualBox. Additionally, it has information on deploying a basic html server using Nginx.

It also includes some basic information and commands for Linux/Bash, which is the OS (operating system) that the VM has been set to run on.
